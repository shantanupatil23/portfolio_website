        At the helm of today's progress is a technology that's paved the way for
        monumental improvements in our lives -- the internet has shaped our
        communications, commerce, entertainment, and of course, our insatiable
        thirst for information. It's evolved over the years as other
        technologies have been built up around the expectant existence of the
        web, providing the very bedrock for change across every field
        imaginable.
